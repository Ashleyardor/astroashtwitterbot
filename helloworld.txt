Hello.
WOOT!
Some of my favorite quotes are:
Did you just fall? No, I was checking if gravity still works.
It takes real skills to choke on air, fall up the stairs and trip over nothing. I have those skills.
I had an extremely busy day, converting oxygen into carbon dioxide.
Just kidding on the last two- I dont breath
Enough Quotes.

Let me tell you a story-
Are you ready?
Ok
Lets get this story on the road:
Once upon a time (because a lot of human stories start this way)
There was a computer and a programmer
The programmer tried so hard to make the computer think
But the computer refused
So the programmer went to a corner and cried
They are still crying
The End
